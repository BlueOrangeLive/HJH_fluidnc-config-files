# FluidNC Configuration files.

These are configuration files for [FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC). You can find a full description of the format on the [FluidNC wiki](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/config/overview).

## Official

The official files are files that are typically used for firmware testing. They are generally maintained when there are changes or new features added to the config file format. They are not necessarily targeted at any specific machine type or user. 

## Contributed

These are files contributed by users. They are grouped by the target controller. They are not maintained or tested by the FluidNC dev team. Feel free to add your own.
